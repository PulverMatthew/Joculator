Joculator Description:
Joculator is a clone of the popular poker-solitaire roguelite Balatro. The game will be built for the command line for simplicity. 
For simplicity, the program will only implement the basic game loop instead of copying the whole game.
Some wishlist features:
1. Joker support, cards which give buffs to your given hand.
2. Shop support, a shop to spend the money awarded after every blind.
3. Special card support, like tarot cards, or other special cards different from Balatro.
4. De-selecting cards.
5. Multiplayer support, beat the other player's hand to advance.
   - Not sure if I should do P2P or Server-Client design. Probably P2P for now.
6. GUI integration, running the game in a GUI with mouse interactivity.
